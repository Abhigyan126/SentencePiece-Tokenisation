It was quite clear that it would not have happened the family would not have been disgraced and the world of Gammer would not have been stunned and horrified if Chawker Minor had not made the Grand Tour

It wasnt exactly illegal to make the Grand Tour but on Gammer at least it was not really socially acceptable Elder Chawker had been against it from the start to do him justice but then Lady Chawker took the side of her minor and mothers are at times not to be withstood Chawker was her second child both of them sons as it happened and she would have no more of course so it was not surprising that she doted on him

Her younger son had wanted to see the Other Worlds of the Orbit and had promised to stay away no longer than a year She had wept and worried and gone into a tragic decline and then finally had dried her eyes and spoken stiffly to Elder Chawker and Chawker Minor had gone

Now he was back one year to the day he was always one to keep his word and besides Elders support would have ceased the day after never fear and the family made holiday

Elder wore a new black glossy shirt but would not permit the prim lines of his face to relax nor would he stoop to ask for details He had no interest no interest whatever in the Other Worlds with their strange ways and their primitive browsing no better than the ways on Earth of which Gammerpeople never spoke

He said Your complexion is dirtied and spoiled Chawker Minor The use of the full name showed his displeasure

Chawker laughed and the clear skin of his rather thin face crinkled I stayed out of the sun as much as I could Elder mine but the Other Worlders would not always have it so

Lady Chawker would have none of Elders criticism either She said warmly It isnt dirtied at all Elder It breathes a warmth

Of the Sun grumbled Elder and it would be next that he would be grubbing in the filth they have there

No farming for me Elder Thats hard work I visited the fungus vats at times though

Chawker Major older than Minor by three years wider of face heavier of body but otherwise of close resemblance was torn between envy of his younger brothers having seen different worlds of the Orbit and revulsion at the thought of it He said Did you eat their Prime Minor

I had to eat something said Chawker Minor Of course there were your packages Lady mine lifesavers sometimes

I suppose said Elder Chawker with distaste the Prime was inedible there Who can tell the filth that found its way into it

Come now Elder mine Chawker paused as though attempting to choose words then shrugged Well it held body and soul together One got used to it I wont say more than that But Elder Lady mine I am so glad to be home The lights are so warm and gentle

Youve enough of the Sun I take it said Elder But you would go Well welcome back to the inner world with light and warmth under our control locked away from the patch and blaze of sunshine Welcome back to the womb of the people as the saying goes

Yet Im glad I went said Chawker Minor Eight different worlds you know It gives you a view you dont have otherwise

And would be better off not having said Elder

Im not sure about that said Chawker Minor and his right eyelid trembled just slightly as he looked at Major Chawker Majors lips compressed but he said nothing

It was a feast Anyone would have had to admit that and in the end it was Chawker Minor himself the greediest to begin with who was the first to push away He had no choice else Lady would have kept on supplying him with samples out of what seemed to be a bottomless larder

Lady mine he said affectionately my tongue wearies I can no longer taste anything

You not taste said Lady What kind of nithling story is that You have the skill of the Grand Elder himself At the age of six you were already a Gustator we had endless proof of that There was not an additive you could not detect even when you could not pronounce it right

Taste buds blunt when not used said Elder Chawker darkly and jogging the Other Worlds can utterly spoil a man

Yes Well let us see said Lady Minor mine tell your doubting Elder what you have eaten

In order said Chawker Minor

Yes Show him you remember

Chawker Minor closed his eyes Its scarcely a fair test he said I so relished the taste I did not pause to analyze it and its been so long

He has excuses See Lady said Elder

But I will try Chawker Minor said hastily In the first place the Prime base for all of them is from the fungus vats of the East Section and the thirteenth corridor within it I believe unless great changes have been made in my absence

No you are right said Lady with satisfaction

And it was expensive said Elder

The prodigal returns said Chawker Major just a bit acidly and we must have the fatted fungus as the saying goes Get the additives Minor if you can

Well said Chawker Minor the first dab was strongly Spring Morning with added Leaves A Freshened and a touch not more than a touch of Spara Sprig

Perfectly right said Lady smiling happily

Chawker Minor went on with the list his eyes still closed his taste memory rolling backward and forward luxuriously over the tang and consistency of the samplings He skipped the eighth and came back to it
